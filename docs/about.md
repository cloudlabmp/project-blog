### About Me

- ⚡ I like technology that actually works. Not hype, not complexity for the sake of it – just smart, practical solutions that solve real problems.
- 🎯 My approach to IT is straightforward: learn what’s useful, implement it properly, and make things better.
- 🚀 I don’t follow trends just because they’re trends. If a new technology makes sense, I’ll dig into it, test it, and figure out how to use it in a way that improves reliability, efficiency, and security. If it doesn’t? I move on.

### What I Focus On: 🔍

- ✅ Learning with purpose – staying ahead, but only where it counts
- ✅ Making things work – cloud, automation, security, infrastructure
- ✅ Cutting through the noise – useful tech over pointless buzzwords
- ✅ Helping others – sharing knowledge when it actually benefits someone

💡 IT should be effective, not overcomplicated. If something needs fixing, I’ll fix it. If it can be improved, I’ll improve it. And if it’s just a waste of time? I’ll call it what it is.
