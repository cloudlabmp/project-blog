# üîÑ Bringing Patch Management In-House: Migrating from MSP to Azure Update Manager

> It's all fun and games until the MSP contract expires and you realise 90 odd VMs still need their patching schedules sorted‚Ä¶

With our MSP contract winding down, the time had come to bring VM patching *back in house*. Our third-party provider had been handling it with their own tooling ‚Äî opaque, over-engineered, and far too expensive for what it did.

Enter [Azure Update Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/update-manager/overview) ‚Äî the modern, agentless way to manage patching schedules across your Azure VMs. Add a bit of PowerShell, sprinkle in some Azure Policy, and you've got yourself a scalable, policy-driven solution that's more visible, auditable, and way more maintainable.

Here's how I made the switch ‚Äî and managed to avoid a patching panic.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites & Permissions

Let's get the plumbing sorted before diving in.

You'll need:

* The right **PowerShell modules**:

  ```powershell
  Install-Module Az -Scope CurrentUser -Force
  Import-Module Az.Maintenance, Az.Resources, Az.Compute
  ```

* An account with **Contributor** permissions (or higher)
* Registered providers to avoid mysterious error messages:

  ```powershell
  Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Maintenance
  Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.GuestConfiguration
  ```

> **Why Resource Providers?** Azure Update Manager needs these registered to create the necessary API endpoints and resource types in your subscription. Without them, you'll get cryptic "resource type not found" errors.

## üïµÔ∏è Step 1 ‚Äì Audit the Current Setup

First order of business: collect the patching summary data from the MSP ‚Äî which, helpfully, came in the form of multiple weekly CSV exports.

I uploaded the files into ChatGPT and had it wrangle the mess into a structured format. The result was a clear categorisation of VMs based on the day and time they were typically patched ‚Äî a solid foundation to work from.

---

## üß± Step 2 ‚Äì Create Seven New Maintenance Configurations

This is the foundation of Update Manager ‚Äî define your recurring patch windows.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand: **Create Maintenance Configurations Script**</summary>

```powershell
# Azure Update Manager - Create Weekly Maintenance Configurations
# Pure PowerShell syntax

# Define parameters
$resourceGroupName = "rg-maintenance-uksouth-001"
$location = "uksouth"
$timezone = "GMT Standard Time"
$startDateTime = "2024-06-01 21:00"
$duration = "03:00"  # 3 hours - meets minimum requirement

# Day mapping for config naming (3-letter lowercase)
$dayMap = @{
    "Monday"    = "mon"
    "Tuesday"   = "tue" 
    "Wednesday" = "wed"
    "Thursday"  = "thu"
    "Friday"    = "fri"
    "Saturday"  = "sat"
    "Sunday"    = "sun"
}

# Create maintenance configurations for each day
foreach ($day in $dayMap.Keys) {
    $shortDay = $dayMap[$day]
    $configName = "contoso-maintenance-config-vms-$shortDay"
    
    Write-Host "Creating: $configName for $day..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    
    try {
        $result = New-AzMaintenanceConfiguration `
            -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
            -Name $configName `
            -MaintenanceScope "InGuestPatch" `
            -Location $location `
            -StartDateTime $startDateTime `
            -Timezone $timezone `
            -Duration $duration `
            -RecurEvery "Week $day" `
            -InstallPatchRebootSetting "IfRequired" `
            -ExtensionProperty @{"InGuestPatchMode" = "User"} `
            -WindowParameterClassificationToInclude @("Critical", "Security") `
            -LinuxParameterClassificationToInclude @("Critical", "Security") `
            -Tag @{
                "Application"  = "Azure Update Manager"
                "Owner"        = "Contoso"
                "PatchWindow"  = $shortDay
            } `
            -ErrorAction Stop
            
        Write-Host "‚úì SUCCESS: $configName" -ForegroundColor Green
        
        # Quick validation
        $createdConfig = Get-AzMaintenanceConfiguration -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $configName
        Write-Host "  Validated: $($createdConfig.RecurEvery) schedule confirmed" -ForegroundColor Gray
        
    } catch {
        Write-Host "‚úó FAILED: $configName - $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
        continue
    }
}
```

</details>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Don't forget: duration format is ISO 8601, not "2 hours" ‚Äî and start time has to match the day it's tied to.*

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 3 ‚Äì Tweak the Maintenance Configs

Some patch windows felt too tight ‚Äî and, just as importantly, I needed to avoid overlaps with existing backup jobs. Rather than let a large CU fail halfway through or run headlong into an Azure Backup job, I extended the duration on select configs and staggered them across the week:

```powershell
$config = Get-AzMaintenanceConfiguration -ResourceGroupName "rg-maintenance-uksouth-001" -Name "contoso-maintenance-config-vms-sun"
$config.Duration = "04:00"
Update-AzMaintenanceConfiguration -ResourceGroupName "rg-maintenance-uksouth-001" -Name "contoso-maintenance-config-vms-sun" -Configuration $config

# Verify the change
$updatedConfig = Get-AzMaintenanceConfiguration -ResourceGroupName "rg-maintenance-uksouth-001" -Name "contoso-maintenance-config-vms-sun"
Write-Host "Sunday window now: $($updatedConfig.Duration) duration" -ForegroundColor Green
```

> Better to have time and not need it than need it and trigger a post-patch incident.

---

## ü§ñ Step 4 ‚Äì Use AI to Group VMs by Patch Activity

Armed with a jumble of CSV exports that made sense to nobody but the person who created them, I got AI to do the grunt work.

**What I did:**

1. **Exported MSP data:** Weekly CSV reports showing patch installation timestamps for each VM
2. **Uploaded to ChatGPT** with this prompt:
   > "Analyze these patch installation times and group VMs by day/time patterns. Most VMs seem clustered on weekends - suggest optimal distribution across 7 maintenance windows for business continuity."

3. **AI analysis revealed:**
   * 60% of VMs were patching Saturday/Sunday (risky for business continuity)
   * Several critical systems patching simultaneously
   * No consideration for application dependencies

4. **AI recommendation:** Spread VMs across weekdays based on:
   * **Criticality:** Domain controllers on different days
   * **Function:** Similar servers on different days (avoid single points of failure)  
   * **Dependencies:** Database servers before application servers

**The result:** A logical rebalancing that avoided "all our eggs in Sunday 1AM" basket and considered business impact.

> **Why this matters:** The MSP was optimizing for their convenience, not our business continuity. AI helped identify risks we hadn't considered.

## üîç Step 5 ‚Äì Discover All VMs and Identify Gaps

Before diving into bulk tagging, I needed to understand what we were working with across all subscriptions.

**First, let's see what VMs we have:**

    $hasUpdatesTag = $VM.Tags -and $VM.Tags.ContainsKey("Updates") -and $VM.Tags["Updates"] -eq "Azure Update Manager"
    $hasPatchWindowTag = $VM.Tags -and $VM.Tags.ContainsKey("PatchWindow")
    
    return $hasOwnerTag -and $hasUpdatesTag -and $hasPatchWindowTag
}

**Discovery results:**

* **12 additional VMs** not in the MSP schedule (the "stragglers")
* **Total: 47 VMs** needing Update Manager tags

> **Key insight:** The MSP wasn't managing everything. Several dev/test VMs and a few production systems were missing from their schedule entirely.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Step 6 ‚Äì Bulk Tag All VMs with Patch Windows

Now for the main event: tagging all VMs with their maintenance windows. This includes both our planned VMs and the newly discovered ones.

### üéØ Main VM Tagging (Planned Schedule)

Each tag serves a specific purpose:

* `PatchWindow` ‚Äî The key tag used by dynamic scopes to assign VMs to maintenance configurations
* `Owner` ‚Äî For accountability and filtering
* `Updates` ‚Äî Identifies VMs managed by Azure Update Manager

## üß∞ Step 7 ‚Äì Configure Azure Policy Prerequisites

Here's where things get interesting. Update Manager is built on compliance ‚Äî but your VMs won't show up in dynamic scopes unless they meet certain prerequisites. Enter Azure Policy to save the day.

You'll need two specific built-in policies assigned at the subscription (or management group) level:

### ‚úÖ Policy 1: `Set prerequisites for scheduling recurring updates on Azure virtual machines`

**What it does:** This policy ensures your VMs have the necessary extensions and configurations to participate in Azure Update Manager. It automatically:

* Installs the Azure Update Manager extension on Windows VMs
* Registers required resource providers (`Microsoft.Maintenance`, `Microsoft.GuestConfiguration`)
* Configures the VM to report its update compliance status
* Sets the patch mode to "AutomaticByPlatform" where needed

> **Why this matters:** Without this policy, VMs won't appear in Update Manager scopes even if they're tagged correctly. The policy handles all the "plumbing" automatically.

**Assignment scope:** Apply this at subscription or management group level to catch all VMs.

### ‚úÖ Policy 2: `Configure periodic checking for missing system updates on Azure virtual machines`

**What it does:** This is your compliance engine. It configures VMs to:

* Regularly scan for available updates (but not install them automatically)
* Report update status back to Azure Update Manager
* Enable the compliance dashboard views in the portal
* Provide the data needed for maintenance configuration targeting

> **Why this matters:** This policy turns on the "update awareness" for your VMs. Without it, Azure Update Manager has no visibility into what patches are needed.

**Assignment scope:** Same as above ‚Äî subscription or management group level.

### üéØ Assigning the Policies

**Step-by-step in Azure Portal:**

1. **Navigate to Azure Policy**
   * Azure Portal ‚Üí Search "Policy" ‚Üí Select "Policy"

2. **Find the First Policy**
   * Left menu: **Definitions**
   * Search: `Set prerequisites for scheduling recurring updates`
   * Click on the policy title

3. **Assign the Policy**
   * Click **Assign** button
   * **Scope:** Select your subscription(s)
   * **Basics:** Leave policy name as default
   * **Parameters:** Leave as default
   * **Remediation:** ‚úÖ Check "Create remediation task"
   * **Review + create**

4. **Repeat for Second Policy**
   * Search: `Configure periodic checking for missing system updates`
   * Follow same assignment process

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Policy compliance can take 30+ minutes to evaluate and apply. Perfect time for that brew I mentioned earlier.

### üîç Monitoring Compliance

Once assigned, you can track compliance in **Azure Policy > Compliance**. Look for:

* Non-compliant VMs that need the extension installed
* VMs that aren't reporting update status properly
* Any policy assignment errors that need investigation

## üß™ Step 8 ‚Äì Create Dynamic Scopes in Update Manager

This is where it all comes together ‚Äî and where the magic happens.

Dynamic scopes use those `PatchWindow` tags to assign VMs to the correct patch config automatically. No more manual VM assignment, no more "did we remember to add the new server?" conversations.

### üéØ The Portal Dance

Unfortunately, as of writing, dynamic scopes can only be configured through the Azure portal ‚Äî no PowerShell or ARM template support yet.

> **Why portal only?** Dynamic scopes are still in preview, and Microsoft hasn't released the PowerShell cmdlets or ARM template schemas yet. This means you can't fully automate the deployment, but the functionality itself works perfectly.

Here's the step-by-step:

1. **Navigate to Azure Update Manager**
   * Portal ‚Üí All Services ‚Üí Azure Update Manager

2. **Access Maintenance Configurations**
   * Go to **Maintenance Configurations (Preview)**
   * Select one of your configs (e.g., `contoso-maintenance-config-vms-mon`)

3. **Create Dynamic Scope**
   * Click **Dynamic Scopes** ‚Üí **Add**
   * **Name:** `DynamicScope-Monday-VMs`
   * **Description:** `Auto-assign Windows VMs tagged for Monday maintenance`

4. **Configure Scope Settings**
   * **Subscription:** Select your subscription(s)
   * **Resource Type:** `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`
   * **OS Type:** `Windows` (create separate scopes for Linux if needed)

5. **Set Tag Filters**
   * **Tag Name:** `PatchWindow`
   * **Tag Value:** `mon` (must match your maintenance config naming)
   * **Additional filters** (optional):
     * `Owner` = `Contoso`
     * `Updates` = `Azure Update Manager`

6. **Review and Create**
   * Verify the filter logic
   * Click **Create**

### üîÑ Repeat for All Days

You'll need to create dynamic scopes for each maintenance configuration:

| Maintenance Config | Dynamic Scope Name | Tag Filter |
|---|---|---|
| `contoso-maintenance-config-vms-mon` | `DynamicScope-Monday-VMs` | `PatchWindow = mon` |
| `contoso-maintenance-config-vms-tue` | `DynamicScope-Tuesday-VMs` | `PatchWindow = tue` |
| `contoso-maintenance-config-vms-wed` | `DynamicScope-Wednesday-VMs` | `PatchWindow = wed` |
| `contoso-maintenance-config-vms-thu` | `DynamicScope-Thursday-VMs` | `PatchWindow = thu` |
| `contoso-maintenance-config-vms-fri` | `DynamicScope-Friday-VMs` | `PatchWindow = fri` |
| `contoso-maintenance-config-vms-sat` | `DynamicScope-Saturday-VMs` | `PatchWindow = sat-09` |
| `contoso-maintenance-config-vms-sun` | `DynamicScope-Sunday-VMs` | `PatchWindow = sun` |

### üîç Verify Dynamic Scope Assignment

Once created, you can verify the scopes are working:

1. **In the Maintenance Configuration:**
   * Go to **Dynamic Scopes**
   * Check **Resources** tab to see matched VMs
   * Verify expected VM count matches your tagging
   * **Wait time:** Allow 15-30 minutes for newly tagged VMs to appear

2. **What success looks like:**
   * Monday scope shows 5 VMs (WEB-PROD-01, DB-PROD-01, etc.)
   * Saturday scope shows 5 VMs (WEB-DEV-01, DB-DEV-01, etc.)
   * No VMs showing? Check tag case sensitivity and filters

3. **In Azure Resource Graph:**

   ```kusto
   MaintenanceResources
   | where type == "microsoft.maintenance/configurationassignments"
   | extend vmName = tostring(split(resourceId, "/")[8])
   | extend configName = tostring(properties.maintenanceConfigurationId)
   | project vmName, configName, resourceGroup
   | order by configName, vmName
   ```

4. **Troubleshoot empty scopes:**
   * Verify subscription selection includes all your VMs
   * Check tag spelling: `PatchWindow` (case sensitive)
   * Confirm resource type filter: `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines`
   * Wait longer - it can take up to 30 minutes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Gotchas

**Tag Case Sensitivity:** Dynamic scopes are case-sensitive. `mon` ‚â† `Mon` ‚â† `MON`

**Subscription Scope:** Ensure you've selected all relevant subscriptions in the scope configuration.

**Resource Type Filter:** Don't forget to set the resource type filter ‚Äî without it, you'll match storage accounts, networking, etc.

**Timing:** It can take 15-30 minutes for newly tagged VMs to appear in dynamic scopes.

## üöÄ Step 9 ‚Äì Test & Verify (The Moment of Truth)

The acid test: does it actually patch stuff properly?

### üé™ Proof of Concept Test

I started conservatively ‚Äî scoped `contoso-maintenance-config-vms-sun` to a few non-critical VMs and let it run overnight on Sunday.

**Monday morning verification:**

* ‚úîÔ∏è **Patch compliance dashboard:** All green ticks
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Reboot timing:** Machines restarted within their 4-hour window (21:00-01:00)
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Update logs:** Activity logs showed expected patching behavior
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Business impact:** Zero helpdesk tickets on Monday morning

### üìä Full Rollout Verification

Once confident with the Sunday test, I enabled all remaining dynamic scopes and monitored the week:

**Key metrics tracked:**

* Patch compliance percentage across all VMs
* Failed patch installations (and root causes)
* Reboot timing adherence
* Business hours impact (spoiler: zero)

### üîç Monitoring & Validation Tools

**Azure Update Manager Dashboard:**

```
Azure Portal ‚Üí Update Manager ‚Üí Overview
- Patch compliance summary
- Recent patch installations
- Failed installations with details
```

**Azure Resource Graph Queries:**

```kusto
// Verify all VMs have maintenance tags
Resources
| where type == "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines"
| where tags.Updates == "Azure Update Manager"
| project name, resourceGroup, subscriptionId, 
          patchWindow = tags.PatchWindow,
          owner = tags.Owner
| summarize count() by patchWindow
| order by patchWindow

// Check maintenance configuration assignments
MaintenanceResources
| where type == "microsoft.maintenance/configurationassignments"
| extend vmName = tostring(split(resourceId, "/")[8])
| extend configName = tostring(properties.maintenanceConfigurationId)
| project vmName, configName, subscriptionId
| summarize VMCount = count() by configName
| order by configName
```

**PowerShell Verification:**

```powershell
# Quick check of maintenance configuration status
Get-AzMaintenanceConfiguration -ResourceGroupName "rg-maintenance-uksouth-001" | 
    Select-Object Name, MaintenanceScope, RecurEvery | 
    Format-Table -AutoSize

# Verify VM tag distribution
$subscriptions = Get-AzSubscription | Where-Object { $_.State -eq "Enabled" }
$tagSummary = @{}

foreach ($sub in $subscriptions) {
    Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId $sub.Id | Out-Null
    $vms = Get-AzVM | Where-Object { $_.Tags.PatchWindow }
    
    foreach ($vm in $vms) {
        $window = $vm.Tags.PatchWindow
        if (-not $tagSummary.ContainsKey($window)) {
            $tagSummary[$window] = 0
        }
        $tagSummary[$window]++
    }
}

Write-Host "=== VM DISTRIBUTION BY PATCH WINDOW ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
$tagSummary.GetEnumerator() | Sort-Object Name | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "$($_.Key): $($_.Value) VMs" -ForegroundColor White
}
```

### üìà Success Metrics

After two full weeks of operation:

* **47 VMs** successfully transitioned to Azure Update Manager
* **100% patch compliance** maintained
* **Zero business-hours incidents** related to patching
* **Estimated annual savings:** ¬£15,000+ (no more MSP patching fees)
* **Visibility improvement:** Real-time patch status vs. weekly email reports

## üìÉ Final Thoughts & Tips

‚úÖ **Cost-neutral** ‚Äî No more third-party patch agents
‚úÖ **Policy-driven** ‚Äî Enforced consistency with Azure Policy
‚úÖ **Easily auditable** ‚Äî Tag-based scoping is clean and visible
‚úÖ **Scalable** ‚Äî New VMs auto-join patch schedules via tagging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide & Common Issues

Here's what I learned the hard way, so you don't have to:

| **Symptom** | **Possible Cause** | **Fix** |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| VM not showing in dynamic scope | Tag typo or case mismatch | Verify `PatchWindow` tag exactly matches config name |
| Maintenance config creation fails | Invalid duration format | Use ISO 8601 format: `"03:00"` not `"3 hours"` |
| VM skipped during patching | Policy prerequisites not met | Check Azure Policy compliance dashboard |
| No updates applied despite schedule | VM needs pending reboot | Clear previous reboots, check update history |
| Dynamic scope shows zero VMs | Wrong subscription scope | Verify subscription selection in scope config |
| Extension installation failed | Insufficient permissions | Ensure VM contributor rights and resource provider registration |
| Policy compliance stuck at 0% | Assignment scope too narrow | Check policy is assigned at subscription level |
| VMs appear/disappear from scope | Tag inconsistency | Run tag verification script across all subscriptions |

### üîß Advanced Troubleshooting Commands

**Check VM Update Readiness:**

```powershell
# Verify VM has required extensions and configuration
$vmName = "your-vm-name"
$rgName = "your-resource-group"

$vm = Get-AzVM -Name $vmName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Status
$vm.Extensions | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*Update*" -or $_.Name -like "*Maintenance*" }
```

**Validate Maintenance Configuration:**

```powershell
# Test maintenance configuration is properly formed
$config = Get-AzMaintenanceConfiguration -ResourceGroupName "rg-maintenance-uksouth-001" -Name "contoso-maintenance-config-vms-mon"
Write-Host "Config Name: $($config.Name)"
Write-Host "Recurrence: $($config.RecurEvery)"
Write-Host "Duration: $($config.Duration)"
Write-Host "Start Time: $($config.StartDateTime)"
Write-Host "Timezone: $($config.TimeZone)"
```

# Check specific VMs for policy compliance
$policyName = "Set prerequisites for scheduling recurring updates on Azure virtual machines"
$assignments = Get-AzPolicyAssignment | Where-Object { $_.Properties.DisplayName -eq $policyName }
foreach ($assignment in $assignments) {
    Get-AzPolicyState -PolicyAssignmentId $assignment.PolicyAssignmentId | 
        Where-Object { $_.ComplianceState -eq "NonCompliant" } |
        Select-Object ResourceId, ComplianceState, @{Name="Reason";Expression={$_.PolicyEvaluationDetails.EvaluatedExpressions.ExpressionValue}}
}
```
