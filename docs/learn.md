# Learn üìñ

Welcome to my learning page!   
This is where I document my hands-on training, technical experiments, and personal projects‚Äîboth work-related and those I explore in my own time. I‚Äôm a firm believer in lifelong learning, constantly refining my skills and tackling new challenges across Azure, AWS, DevOps, and beyond. This space is a reflection of that journey‚Äîpractical, focused, and always evolving. Take a look around!
